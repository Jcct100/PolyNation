# Poly Nation
This is a web app that allow users to search for live gigs from around the world and stream live music. 

# Technologies: 
React, React Router, Redux, Context API, Google Map API, Word Press API and HTML5 Audio.  

# Approach:
I was looking at leaflet.js and Google Map API, in the end I decided to go with Google Map because it has more features. I was working in a team of 5. The project was managed in sprint. I was mainly responsible for building the front end of the project including the Google Map, Search Bar and Play Bar. 

In this project I learnt about thinking React such as making most of the component usable like I did with the search bar and play bar.
